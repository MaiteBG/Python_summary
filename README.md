## What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **versatility**.  
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including **procedural**, **object-oriented**, and **functional** programming.

Python is widely used in:
- Web development
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
- Automation
- Scripting

Its clean syntax makes it great for beginners and powerful enough for professionals.


## What does "Pythonic" mean?

**Pythonic** refers to code that follows the **idioms and best practices of the Python language** — clean, readable, and efficient.

Writing Pythonic code means:
- Using clear and concise syntax
- Leveraging Python’s features (like list comprehensions, unpacking, etc.)
- Following the principles in **The Zen of Python**
  * Beautiful is better than ugly.
  * Explicit is better than implicit.
  * Simple is better than complex.
  * Complex is better than complicated.
  * Flat is better than nested.
  * Sparse is better than dense.
  * Readability counts.
  * Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  * Although practicality beats purity.
  * Errors should never pass silently.
  * Unless explicitly silenced.
  * In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  * There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  * Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  * Now is better than never.
  * Although never is often better than *right* now.
  * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  * If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  * Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
